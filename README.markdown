Hi there!

#goodnite
is a pretty simple zimlet built for the Zimbra Collaboration Suite that looks at your school's ldap database and tells a user if it's time for them to reset their password.

##You'll need to Add:
  Configuration data for your ldap host (see sample_config.jsp)
  your domains in sample_config_template.xml (which should be renamed to config_template.xml)
